In this report, we used tensor networks methods to examine the behavior of 1D Ising chain Hamiltonian for medium-sized systems. In particular, these methods enabled the overcoming of the exponential scaling problem, which is common for numerical evaluation of quantum problems.\\
For the Ising chain, we were able to extract correlations between different sites, the magnetization and correlation length.

On day 2 we furthermore focused on the time evolution of the Ising model.
We were able to identify the excitation and therein connected kinks.
We therefore considered the time evolution of the correlations.
There one could nicely see the outwards propagation for no longitudinal field and the confinement for an applied longitudinal field.
We furthermore were able to show that our bound states are pretty close to the theoretical expectation - the negative roots of the Airy function.
